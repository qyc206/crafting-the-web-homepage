# Crafting the Web Homepage

This is my homepage for holding and displaying the work that I have completed for the course: Crafting the Web (Fall 2022)

# Briefly about the course

Crafting the Web is a studio course that introduces the basics of HTML, CSS, and web publishing as well as the history of the web, internet art, and cyberfeminism. In this course, we hand craft web projects from scratch that are self-hosted and/or presented on experimental servers that are maintained according to feminist principles.
